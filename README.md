quickLinks uses fuzzysearch to sort bookmarks, notes, etc.

I like the fuzzy searching feature in sublime text because its so darn efficient and allows me to avoid using the mouse. Browsers have this functionality built in to some extent, but there are a lot of instances when I want to share my links with people or test pages on different devices without syncing bookmarks.

This app uses the MEAN stack.
